# Scat UI

Scat UI is a UI library built on top of Shadcn, designed to create dynamic components as fast as lightning ⚡.

## 1. How to Use

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malasngodings/scat-ui.git
```

## 2. Copy Components

Go to /components/scat-ui, copy and paste the component that you want to your project.

## 3.  Ensure Shadcn is Installed

Make sure Shadcn is installed with the necessary components. If you haven’t installed it yet, run:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add {component}
```

## 4.  Using Components from the Registry

Scat UI provides a /registry/ directory where you can preview and explore available components before using them in your project.

To use a component:

1. Navigate to /registry/.
2. Browse and select a component.
3. Copy the component's code and integrate it into your project.

## Continuous Updates & Maintenance

Scat UI is actively maintained and will be progressively updated with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. We are committed to keeping the library up-to-date and enhancing its performance over time.
